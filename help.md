# THELinux Help.
 We have multiple sources where you can get support/help with THELinux.
 
 The most active is probably our Discord server. (Currently going through a rebrand.)
 
 You can also get support on the [Issues](https://github.com/THELinux/issues) tab. (May be slower.)
 
 Other sources will be added soon.
